# Community-Driven E-Commerce Platform  
**2-Page Requirements Document**

---

## 1. Project Overview

This platform is a highly scalable, community-driven e-commerce system inspired by leading platforms like Amazon, but designed for social good. It enables users to give away unwanted items (starting with clothing) for free, while those in need can claim them. The system incorporates advanced privacy, an "In Need" access layer, community-based verification, sponsor-driven operational support, and a responsible advertising program to help fund operations.

# Legal & Ethical Guidance for Community-Driven E-Commerce Platform

---

## 1. Public Statement: Legal & Ethical Stance

As the founder and maintainer of this community-driven platform, I am committed to upholding the highest standards of legal and ethical conduct. This project is:

- **Open Source and Volunteer-Driven:** All contributions are voluntary and unpaid. The project is not operated for profit, and no compensation is provided to contributors, especially those based in the United States on F1 student visas.
- **Compliant with F1 Visa Regulations:** As an F1 student, I do not receive any income, salary, or compensation from this project while residing in the United States. All work is conducted as a personal, open-source, and community initiative.
- **India-Focused Launch:** The platform is intended for launch and operation in India, with hosting and legal entities (if any) based in India. Any financial or legal operations are managed by Indian residents or entities, not by U.S.-based individuals.
- **Transparent and Inclusive:** All project activities, decisions, and finances (if any) are documented and open to the community for review.

## 4. Open-Source Licensing Guidance

### A. Choosing a License
- **MIT License:** Simple, permissive, allows commercial use, requires attribution
- **Apache 2.0:** Like MIT, but with explicit patent rights
- **GPLv3:** Requires derivative works to also be open source (copyleft)
- **Mozilla Public License 2.0:** File-level copyleft, more flexible than GPL

### B. How to Apply a License
1. Add a `LICENSE` file to your repository with the full text of your chosen license
2. Reference the license in your `README.md`
3. Inform contributors of the license in your `CONTRIBUTING.md`

### C. What It Means
- Contributors and users must follow the license terms
- You retain copyright, but grant broad rights to use, modify, and share
- Choose a license that matches your goals for openness and collaboration

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a complete boilerplate setup for the Community-Driven E-Commerce Platform that enables community contributors to quickly get started with development. The boilerplate will include all 9 microservices, the React frontend, shared utilities, infrastructure configuration, and development tooling - providing a solid foundation that matches the documented architecture and allows contributors to focus on implementing business logic rather than project setup.

2. WHEN I run the setup command THEN all services SHALL have their dependencies installed successfully using their respective package managers
3. WHEN I examine each service directory THEN it SHALL contain src/, tests/, appropriate config files (package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, etc.), and Dockerfile
4. WHEN I look at the project structure THEN it SHALL match exactly the architecture documented in README.md with technology choices clearly documented

### Requirement 2
